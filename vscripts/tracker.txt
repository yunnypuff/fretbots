0.4.0.1
-----------------------------------
TODO: 

Implement dynamic difficulty adjustment for death awards.

Rework neutral item awards such that each hero has its own timing 
per neutral level, and make awards lower the time for the next tier
rather than immediately reward the item.

-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
0.4.0.1
-----------------------------------
Implemented 'Easier' difficulty.

Fixed dumb bug with Debug:Print().

Implemented 'difficulty' chat command.  Lobby hose can dynamically override
the selected difficulty once one has been applied. 'difficulty <votename>'
to apply.

-----------------------------------
0.4.0.0 Dev
-----------------------------------
Refactored Settings.lua.  NeutralItem table and difficulty tables
have been moved to external files, and are loaded via require/dofile.

Local 'difficulties' table from Settings.lua is now global as 'Difficulties'
in order to facilitate dynamic difficulty assertion.

'Difficulties' table copies all difficulties into indices by name as
they are loaded.  Difficulties are still also arranged by numeric index
in order to allow the voting list to appear in order.

Bugfix: The colon immediately following the bot's name in death award 
messages is now the color of the bot's name (was previously green.)

-----------------------------------
0.3.0.5
-----------------------------------
Moved Tier 4 item timing back 400 seconds, and Tier 5 item timing to 60 mintues.

-----------------------------------
0.3.0.4
-----------------------------------
Fixed bug causing voting tallies to be inaccurate. Reverted standard difficulty setting tweaks.

-----------------------------------
0.3.0.3, Maybe
-----------------------------------
Minor tweaks to difficulty to make it a bit easier at standard.

-----------------------------------
0.3.0.2
-----------------------------------
Added support for PCall(text) commands from chat.

-----------------------------------
0.3.0.1
-----------------------------------
Disabled isBuff flag.

-----------------------------------
0.3.0.0
-----------------------------------
Improved Settings chat listener functionality. Settings can now be manipulated via chat:

	'get'				:		Prints the apprpriate Settings table value to chat.
	'set'				:		Modifes the appropriate Settings table value.
	'nudge'			:		Adds the nudge value to all values of a Settings table entry.
	'ddenable'	:		Enables Dynamic Difficulty.
	'ddsuspend' :		Suspends dynamic difficulty.  Current offset bonuses remain.
	'ddreset'		:   Restores offset bonuses to the default of the current settings.
	'ddtoggle'	:		Toggles the enable state of Dynamic Difficulty.

Note that only the host or Fret can currently issue these commands.

Added an option argument to Utilities:Round() to allow rounding to decimal places
rather than just to integers.

Armor, Magic Resist, and Level awards are now rounded to two decimal places rather
than an integer value.

Adjusted random number generator for base awards to return decimal values between
the limits rather than integers; this will result in more granular awards 
for those awards that were adjusted to round to decimals.

Adjusted Level Award logic:
	
	Previously	:		An award of 2 levels would place a bot at the zero experience point
									of the level 2 levels higher than it currently is, which could,
									in theory, mean that it gets basically 1.1 levels if it is already
									near to levelling.  Awards were in integer format.
	Now					:		Awards are rounded to two decimal places.  The XP for the 
									difference between the current level and the ceiling of the bonus
									is calculated.  This value is then averaged by the ceiling of 
									the bonus in order to determine the average amount of XP per
									level awarded.  This average number is then multiplied by the
									levels bonus.  tldr: level awards are now more granular and 
									consistent.  

Implemented first attempt at dynamic difficulty adjustment.  Currently alters
GPM / XPM target offsets based on human kill advantage.  WIP.

Made console debug print messages for death awards more consistent and useful.

Fixed typo in the neutrals table preventing the localized name for clumsy 
net from being printed in awards messages.


-----------------------------------
0.2.1.0
-----------------------------------
Adjusted settings initialization function to use a GameState listener to
prevent it from running before all players have loaded. It should now be
possible to start the script in any game state without issues.

Made existing 'debug' difficulty the baseline difficulty level.  
Renamed to standard.

Changed standard difficulty skil variance lower bound to 1.0 for all 
positions.

Added additional difficulty levels.

Implemented Utilities:DeepCopy() to make applying difficulties a bit simpler.

Adjusted AwardBonus:ShouldAward() to actually play attention to the 
deathStreakThreshold setting.

Implemented Utilities:PlayerCount() to replace PlayerResource:PlayerCount(),
since we never care about non-players, and it returns coaches, etc.

Fixed bug: voting previously included coaches, observers, etc (see above).

Fixed bug: player_chat event listener now returns playerid instead of 
userid (which previously caused some internal confusion).

Reworked vote tracking system to be less crappy.

Vote tracking messages are now color coded by the color of the player 
that voted.

Most player facing messages now use localized hero / item names instead of
the internal name strings.

Add Utilities:ColorString() to facilitate more easy coloring of messages.

Reworked Utilities:Print() to facilitate more nuanced coloring of messages.

Improved vote acceptance messages (printed by color of voting player).

Improved award message printing (color coded award types / hero names).

Tweaked random sound lists.

Added a nag message if isBuff is enabled.

Cleaned up some untidy code.

-----------------------------------
0.2.0.1
-----------------------------------
Made existing 'debug' difficulty the baseline difficulty level.  Renamed to standard.

Added additional difficulty levels.

-----------------------------------
0.2.0.0
-----------------------------------
Implemented a generic GameStateListener class to facilitate the calling
of functions that we only want to run once at during a particular game state.

Implemented a tiered gamestate/timer initialization system in order to 
(hopefully) properly initalize the script regardless of point of the point
at which it is invoked from the console (including pick phase).

Implemented the choosing of settings by team chat during PreGame. 

-----------------------------------
0.1.4.2
-----------------------------------
Reverted 'debug' settings to previous values (time scale factor for death bonuses disabled, neutral items for bots 1 tier ahead of humans).

-----------------------------------
0.1.4.1 Dev
-----------------------------------
Fixed for good (hopefully) fake hero units (Arc Warden / Lone Druid) causing issues

Implemented optional role scaling for death bonuses.

Implemented scaling over time for both variance to death bonus rolls, and death bonus upper clamp.

Balance pass to bonuses

-----------------------------------
0.1.4.0 Dev
-----------------------------------
Balance pass
Increase bot neutral item timing reception by 200s across the board.

Housekeeping
Move GPM and XPM bonus calculation methods from DataTables.lua to AwardBonus.lua
Change GPM/XPM debug table printing to isVerboseDebug level (lower priority since they seem to be working)
