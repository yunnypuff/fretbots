version = '0.4.1.1'
versionString = [[Changelog:
Reworked neutral item awards.  All bots now have their own neutral
item timings, and neutral item death bonuses now subtract a number
of seconds from these timings.  

Implemented a (hopefully) robust random seed generator.

Added I'm Bad's Royal Jelly code so bots actually use it.  Thanks!

Removed Debug:Print() statement from NeutralItemTimer() (too spammy)
